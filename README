Realie - A Realtime Collaborative Code Editor

Aim of this project is to build a pastie/gist sort of an online code sharing utility, with realtime collaboration (similar to Etherpad). I started this project as part of my individual research project in the University.
 You can find my notes related to this project from here - http://www.web2media.net/laktek/tag/realie/

If you like to test out the app you will need to install the following:

1) Chrome Browser (version 5+) - This is because web sockets are still only supported in Chrome. But Firefox and other latest browsers would soon catch up!
2) Redis 2.0 (still in Release Candidate stage) - http://code.google.com/p/redis/
3) Node.js - 0.1.96+ (http://nodejs.org)

Follow the standard installations of above programs as mentioned in their documentation.

Once you have setup those, 
* Clone this repository - https://laktek@github.com/laktek/realie.git

* In app's source path and run:
  `git submodule init`
  `git submodule update`

* Then change the path to "vendor/express" and run:
  `git submodule init`
  `git submodule update`

* Change the path back to head.

* Now start the redis server (normally running, `etc/redis/redis-server`)

* Then again inside the app's source path run :
  `node app.js`

* Open another console tab with the same path and run:
  `node socket.js` 

* Finally, open Chrome and visit:
  http://localhost:3000/pad

** NB: Web Sockets will use the port 8080 to communicate, so you will need to open that port.
